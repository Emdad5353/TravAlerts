# TravAlerts

The “TravAlerts” is a native android mobile application with firebase as backend. 
The purpose of the application is a way to share visitor’s experience including, images, short video clips (approx. 30s), comments, and star ratings. This android app is capable of registering new tourist attractions based upon visitor’s location info (if they intend to do so), along with existing top tourist places under agency’s territory.
Additionally, visitor’s after downloading and installing app, they can share their experiences in form of images or short clips, comments etc. using their geo location. Moreover, non-visitor’s may also share image or clip, they can comment but unable to rate. It is compulsory for visitors to allow automatic detection of location to provide original experiences, otherwise they will be treated as non-visitor. In case of any content shared by visitor, it will be marked by a checkmark or star etc. to differentiate it from the non-visitor. 
Only visitors who want to register a new tourist attraction, they need to signup, otherwise visitors to the existing attractions can use the app as anonymous user by just providing their name. Any existing or first-time user of the app will allow the app to automatically detect his or her location, if it is an existing tourist attraction, it will appear, otherwise user will get a chance to sign up and register the attraction.
Moreover, the app will store data only about tourist attractions, any kind of content related to it and users who sign up. In case of sign up, it will store complete name, email address and mobile no etc.
